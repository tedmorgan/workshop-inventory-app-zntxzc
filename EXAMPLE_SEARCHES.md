**AI Response:**
```
For removing drywall, I recommend these tools from your inventory:

1. **Utility Knife** - Bin A, Shelf 2
   Perfect for scoring and cutting through the drywall paper and 
   creating clean lines for removal.

2. **Pry Bar** - Bin B, Shelf 1
   Essential for prying the drywall away from the studs once you've 
   scored it. The flat end works great for this.

3. **Hammer** - Bin A, Shelf 1
   Useful for punching through the drywall to create starting points 
   for removal, especially in areas you're completely demolishing.

4. **Reciprocating Saw** - Bin C, Garage Wall
   If you need to cut through drywall quickly, especially around 
   fixtures or in tight spaces.

Safety tip: Wear safety glasses and a dust mask, as drywall removal 
creates a lot of dust!

### Example 4: Sanding Project

**AI Response:**
```
For sanding a wooden table, here's what I recommend:

1. **Orbital Sander** - Bin C, Garage Wall
   Perfect for: Smooth, even sanding of flat surfaces like your 
   table top. Much faster than hand sanding.

2. **Sandpaper (various grits)** - Bin D, Tool Chest

   for smoothing, and finish with 220-grit for a silky finish.

3. **Sanding Block** - Bin A, Shelf 3
   Useful for: Edges and corners where the orbital sander can't reach.

Process:
1. Start with coarse grit (80) to remove old finish
2. Progress to medium grit (120) for smoothing
3. Finish with fine grit (220) for a smooth surface
4. Always sand with the grain, not against it

Safety: Wear a dust mask and work in a well-ventilated area!
